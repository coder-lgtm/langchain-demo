## Hands-On workshop to build custom application using LangChain and Vector Databases
This repository contains instructions and code for building custom applications using Langchain, and contextual documents for the Atomic Learning app that we will build live during the workshop.

### Goals
* Get familiarized with advanced concepts surrounding Generative AI
* Review core LLM concepts
* Overview of LangChain and vector datasets
* Build an app using a OpenAPI apis and LangChain python library
  
### Repository contains
* Installation instructions for the Open Source technologies this workshop uses
* Account setup instructions to use Open Sourced Meta Llama2 models
* Code to build simple application using Python
* Sample Domain specific Documents

  
## Pre-workshop setup steps
### We will be using following tools and resources
* Our choice of programming language -  [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)
* Quick and elegant app builder - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
* Place to host and run Machine Learning models in the Cloud - [Replicate](https://replicate.com/explore)
* Open source Large Language Model - [Llama2 by Meta](https://ai.meta.com/llama/)
* I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for coding but you could use any text editor as well

### Setup instructions
- [ ] If you are using Windows, I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for the ease of installation. Create environment in Anaconda, launch a command propmpt and run ```pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt``` <br>
- [ ] For Mac, Install Homebrew if you don't have it. <br>
      Go to a terminal and run ```$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"```
- [ ] Install python 3.8 using homebrew <br>
      ```brew install python@3.8```
      
- [ ] Checkout this repository </br>
      ```git clone git@github.com:coder-lgtm/llm-demo.git``` <br> (You will need to have SSH key setup for this) <br><br>
      OR <br>
      ```git clone https://github.com/coder-lgtm/llm-demo.git``` <br> (You do not need SSH key for setup for this)  <br><br>
      OR <br>
      Just download the repository from https://github.com/coder-lgtm/llm-demo/archive/refs/heads/main.zip and unzip <br>
- [ ] Navigate to llm-demo/app directory and run the following to install dependencies using the requirements.txt <br>
      If you want to run this app locally, you will need to install streamlit and replicate packages. Following command will do 
      just that. <br>
      ```pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt``` <br><br>
      
- [ ] Create an account on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/explore). You should receive an API key that starts with r8_<>. You will need this for this workshop. I used my github account to login, this helps with the integration greatly.

## Workshop Agenda

- [ ] Familiarize yourself with Replicate interface
